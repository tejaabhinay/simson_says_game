# Simon Says: The Memory Challenge 🕹️

A web-based version of the classic memory game. It tests your brain and your ability to follow increasingly complex patterns.

### 🕹️ Engineering Logic
* **Game State Machine:** I used two arrays—one for the game sequence and one for the user's input—to constantly compare and validate progress.
* **Event Listeners:** Efficiently managed DOM events to ensure that user clicks are only registered during their "turn."
* **Visual Feedback:** Used CSS classes and `setTimeout` to create the "flash" effect that mimics the physical game's buttons.
* **Scaling Difficulty:** The game dynamically increases speed and sequence length as the user levels up.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)
* **UI:** HTML5 & CSS3 Animation
